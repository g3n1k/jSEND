# jSEND 2.0 

## Speed up response + increase UX* of your WebApps
> UX is short for User eXperience ~ how a person feels about using your web site or application.

** jSEND is a JavaScript cross browser component for jQuery.**

It provides compression in combination with binary-to-text encoding and achieves significant, lossless information reduction for your data transfers - supporting all kinds of textual data: XML, stringified JSON Objects, (X)HTML, plain text... Test it now!

** jSEND is intended for use in Web 2.0 and rich applications** - as invaluable supplement for post requests via the XMLHTTPRequest object (AJAX/AJAJ).

This software is absolutely free. It's licensed same as jQuery â€“ under the terms of either the MIT License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

# Why use jSEND?

For compressed data delivery from server to browser there are GZip/Deflate.

In the other direction there is - now - jSEND.
## Integrate it in your web application if you want to:
* Increase user experience by faster response times
> Runtime of code is - in most cases - nearly predictable, wire speed isn't. 
* Reduce amounts of transferred data and save bandwith
* Submit UTF-8 data as ASCII string and eliminate different character sets issues & confusion
* Obfuscate information delivered by AJAX posts
> Your users can read and inspect it - e.g. with tools like Live HTTP headers for Firefox. jSEND offers - generously interpreted - a kind of obfuscation, but it's NOT encryption. For that please use HTTPS/SSL.
* Just have fun by Using (our) Solution Productively...
** jSEND is transparent, reliable, lightweight (2.5 KB minified) and fully UTF-8 compatible. ** It is free and open source and can easily be customized to fit your individual needs.
